## 🧩 Description

This repository contains Java solutions for the **Advent of Code** programming puzzles.

The goals of this repo are:

- To practice **problem-solving, algorithms, and data structures** using real puzzle-style problems.
- To maintain a clean, navigable archive of solutions that you (and others) can learn from later.
- To experiment with different implementation styles, optimizations, and refactors over time.

**Who is this for?**

- Students and self-learners looking to see **Java approaches** to AoC puzzles.
- Developers wanting to **compare logic** and **solution structure** with their own.
- Anyone who enjoys puzzles and wants a reference implementation.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Java implementations of Advent of Code puzzles (structured by year and day).
- 🧠 Focus on **readable** and **maintainable** code over golfed/short solutions.
- 📁 Organized directory layout (e.g., `2025/Day01`, `2025/Day02`, etc.).
- 🔍 Easy to extend with new days, years, or alternative approaches.
- 🧪 Ready for future enhancements like unit tests, benchmarks, and CLIs.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack / Requirements

- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+ recommended, JDK 17+ ideal)
- **Build/Run:**  
  - Plain `javac` / `java`, or  
  - Any modern Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extension, Eclipse, etc.)
- **Tools (optional but recommended):**
  - Git
  - JUnit (if/when tests are added)
